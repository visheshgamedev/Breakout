# Breakout
I tried to clone the original Breakout game (Atari Version), but midway decided to make a much better version like the Miniclip Smashing game.

**I haven't worked on this game much so there isn't a playable build**

## Things that I've implemented -
1. Paddle Movement - Just a simple right and left movement.
2. Ball Movement - Ball would launch on Space key press, Ball would bounce back from the paddle depending the collision position, ball collision 
3. Brick Spawner - I've created a simple script to spawn bricks for testing.

## Things I'm planning to implement -

> I would try and replicate the Miniclip Smashing game as much as possible.

1. Rewrite the whole ball bounce script, to make the ball's velocity consistent.
2. Some good game art for the paddle and bricks.
3. Power ups and different type of bricks.
4. Sound effects.
5. Scoring and lives system.
